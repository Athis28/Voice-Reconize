 Project Summary: Voice-Enabled Geospatial Map-Based User Interface

Overview:
This project involves developing a voice-enabled user interface for a geospatial map application. It integrates JavaScript with geospatial data and leverages speech recognition to enhance user interaction.

Key Features:

1. Map Display:
   - OpenStreetMap Tiles: Utilizes OpenStreetMap tiles for base map rendering.
   - Layers: Includes options to toggle between satellite and terrain map layers.

2. Geolocation:
   - Latitude and Longitude: Displays geographic coordinates based on user interactions with the map.

3. Speech Recognition:
   - Voice Commands: Allows users to control map features and navigate through voice commands using the JavaScript Speech Recognition API.

4. Weather Details:
   - Weather Information: Fetches and displays current weather conditions for the userâ€™s location using a weather API.

Process Flow:
1. User Interaction: Users provide voice commands to interact with the map.
2. Voice Command Processing: JavaScript captures and processes these commands.
3. Map Updates: Based on the commands, the map adjusts to show different layers, geo-locations, or fetches weather details.
4. Weather Display: Weather information is updated in real-time based on the current map view.

This integration aims to create an intuitive and interactive map application, enhancing user experience by allowing hands-free operation and providing useful location-based information.
